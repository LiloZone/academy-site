sobre: About LILO.Academy
sobreTitulo1: Real projects
sobreTitulo2: without rehearsals
sobreTexto: In a conventional course, the experiments have already been tested and are only reproduced by the students. At LILO.Academy the experiments are done in real time, bringing together specialists and students in natural paths, risks and challenges provided by the project. Invites you to develop creative skills and solutions that are perfectly aligned with practice.

sobreAprendizagemTitulo: Chaordic Learning
sobreAprendizagemQ1: About LILO.Academy
sobreAprendizagemR1: LILO.Academy is a proposal to merge the production work of LILO.ZONE experts with a hands-on learning opportunity for the public.
sobreAprendizagemQ2: The perfect workshop
sobreAprendizagemR2: LILO.ZONE is a space with digital manufacturing, sewing, electronics and art tools, with a repertoire of materials that allow creative experimentation.
sobreAprendizagemQ3: Intense collaboration and teamwork
sobreAprendizagemR3: Immerse yourself in multidisciplinary projects that require cohesive teams, agility and intense collaboration to deliver a product on time.
sobreAprendizagemQ4: Balance between creativity and achievement
sobreAprendizagemR4: A team of experts ensures pre-production to facilitate project execution. However, unforeseen and open challenges bring creativity and spontaneity to the process.
sobreAprendizagemQ5: Working side by side with experts
sobreAprendizagemR5: Experience the daily life of experts, understanding their strategies, methodologies and tools, and receive several tips and exclusive theoretical references.
sobreAprendizagemQ6: Risks and learning
