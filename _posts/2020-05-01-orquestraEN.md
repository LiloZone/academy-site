descricaoTitulo: Description
d1: Symbiotic orchestra is an interactive musical installation where sounds are generated by a computer system connected to microorganisms. Over the course of three meetings, you will be led to experience microbiological laboratory procedures and also to enter the world of digital fabrication and computer sound production.
d2: The objective of the project is the complete construction of the work, for later exhibition in a Digital Art Gallery, where all collaborators enter as co-authors. The idea was conceived during the meetings of the Microbiology for Artists study group at BioLiloLab, LILO.ZONE's biohacking laboratory.
d3: The project explores the growth of microorganisms collected in São Paulo subway stations, fixing them in custom-made digitally manufactured Petri dishes integrated with a computer system that generates music. The structure of the work, which will support the plates, will also be fully designed and manufactured with laser cutting during the process. Each microorganism will be responsible for one type of sound and Petri dishes can be handled by the audience at the facility to compose different symphonies.
d4: Meetings at different weeks ensure that biological time is accounted for in the process so that microorganisms can grow into beautiful colonies.
